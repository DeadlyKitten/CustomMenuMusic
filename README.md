# CustomMenuMusic

## Custom Menu Music v1.1.0
Changes the music in the menu.
Now you can use either a randomly selected song from all downloaded maps, or use multiple songs selected at random from the `BeatSaber/CustomMenuSongs` folder.

### Configuration
To use songs from the `BeatSaber/CustomMenuSongs` folder, simply go into `Beat Saber\modprefs.ini` and change `UserPrefSongs` to `1`.
