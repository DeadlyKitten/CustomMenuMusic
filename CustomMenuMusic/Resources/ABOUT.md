Custom Menu Music
=================

Custom Menu Music is a mod that lets you add your own music to the menus of Beat Saber!

Configuration
-------------

Check out the settings menu to see all the stuff you can configure!

If you want to add your own music instead of using the music in your Custom Songs library,
add them to the `CustomMenuSongs` folder and make sure the option is turned on in the settings!
